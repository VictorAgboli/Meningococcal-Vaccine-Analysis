# Meningococcal-Vaccine-Analysis
In this project, I analyzed the data collected from the National Immunization Survey â€“ Teen (NIS-Teen) in 2021, focusing on Meningococcal ACWY vaccines. With 18,002 participants, I carried out detailed descriptive analysis, built regression models, and generated estimates and confidence intervals. I identified noteworthy factors like age, education, insurance, and ethnicity that significantly influence adolescent vaccination trends. This helped provide a clearer understanding of how adolescents are getting vaccinated
